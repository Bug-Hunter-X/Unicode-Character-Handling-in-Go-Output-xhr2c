# Unicode Character Handling in Go

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue related to handling Unicode characters in Go's output. The program `bug.go` prints the string "Hello, 世界", which includes the Unicode characters for "world" in Chinese.  This can lead to unexpected behavior depending on the system's terminal and font settings. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.go`, offers a more robust approach, ensuring correct display across different environments.

## Problem

The primary problem stems from potential inconsistencies in character encoding and font support across various terminal emulators and operating systems.  If the terminal or font doesn't support the specific Unicode character used, the output might appear as garbled characters or not display correctly. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.go` file provides a solution, though it doesn't directly fix the underlying issue. Instead, the solution focuses on more robust methods. In this example, this means checking for errors and displaying an appropriate message if a character is not rendered correctly.
